> In the new TicTacToeGame, what would it take to enable the human player to win if they get 5 in a row, while the computer must get 6 in a row?   

I first learned of this exercise watching J. B. Rainsberger's 
[Integrated Tests are a Scam][3] talk.  His [description][2] of the exercise caught
my attention... "All you have to do is turn five into six.  How hard could it be?"

As of 2018-11-11, you can recover Patrick Wilson Welsh's original exercise via
the [google code archives][1].
